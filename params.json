{"name":"Hourglass","tagline":"A Chess Clock for Streaming Tabletop Games","body":"### Hourglass \r\nThis page is still under construction but it includes downloads for the source code and designs for the Hourglass chess clock. The code is complete but messy and should be considered in beta until documentation and feature implementation is complete.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe Hourglass is usable on both Mac and PC (and probably Linux although I haven't built it) in XSplit and OBS. It uses Processing for the software running on the streaming computer and an Arduino as a micro controller for the clock itself.\r\n\r\nCurrent users of the Hourglass are Privateer Press and Chain-Attack.\r\n\r\nThe code and design is being released in the hope that this kind of technology can support streaming tabletop miniatures games.\r\n\r\n### Don't want to build your own?\r\nContact me if you want an Hourglass. I build them custom to the needs of the streamer.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMark Sivak, PhD (@msivak) wrote and designed the Hourglass.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
